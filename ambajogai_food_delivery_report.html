    <h1>Ambajogai — Local Food Delivery Marketplace</h1>
    <div class="muted">Detailed technical + business report (MERN, web-first launch). Prepared for: you & your partner. Date: August 10, 2025</div>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Executive summary</h2>
    <p class="muted">You and your partner will handle design, development, marketing and operations. This report assumes you will self-build the platform and therefore covers only technical infrastructure costs, 3rd-party service costs, operational flows, referral economics (₹150+ rules), legal checklist, deployment plan, data & API design, and financial scenarios for Ambajogai launch.</p>

    <div style="margin-top:12px">
      <span class="kpi">Referral threshold: ₹150+</span>
      <span class="kpi">Platform commission on items: 25% (20% commission + 5% maintenance)</span>
      <span class="kpi">Merchant share: 70%</span>
      <span class="kpi">Referral pool: 5% (non-withdrawable coins, only redeemable on future purchases)</span>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key assumptions used in calculations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Average order value (AOV):</strong> ₹250 (useable baseline — change to model other cases)</li>
      <li><strong>Referral rule:</strong> order must be ≥ ₹150 to trigger referral coin distribution. Coins are non-withdrawable and usable only as discounts on future orders.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform splits:</strong> From the item price only: Merchant 70%, Referral pool 5%, Platform (commission + maintenance) 25%.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery fee:</strong> charged to customer separately (distance-based). Platform keeps a small handling fee (₹5–₹10) per order; remaining paid to rider.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment gateway fee:</strong> average 1.8% of GMV assumed (mix of UPI and cards). Adjust when you select final gateway.</li>
      <li><strong>Maps calls & SMS:</strong> billable third-party usage — included in infrastructure cost lines below.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion / Currency:</strong> all numbers are INR unless marked. USD figures shown for common cloud prices where providers publish USD pricing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Referral economics (precise)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Goal: give coins only for orders ₹150+, maintain an overall referral budget capped at 5% of the item order value, avoid cash payouts to reduce abuse and legal risk.</p>

    <h3>Distribution model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Total referral budget per qualifying order = 5% × item_price</li>
      <li>Distribution across up to 5 levels (configurable). For a safe, conservative start we recommend <strong>2 levels</strong> live and reserve levels 3–5 for future if fraud is controlled. Example split (when using 5 levels) — L1=50%, L2=20%, L3=15%, L4=10%, L5=5% (applied to the referral budget).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Worked example (₹250 order — qualifies)</h3>
    <pre class="mono">Item price = ₹250
Referral budget = 5% × 250 = ₹12.50
Distribution example (5-level):
  L1 (50%) = 0.5 × 12.5 = ₹6.25 -> round to ₹6
  L2 (20%) = 0.2 × 12.5 = ₹2.50 -> ₹3
  L3 (15%) = 1.875 -> ₹2
  L4 (10%) = 1.25 -> ₹1
  L5 (5%) = 0.625 -> ₹1 (or ₹0 depending on rounding rule)
Total ≈ ₹13 (rounding small differences handled by platform reserve)
Notes: coins issued are 'platform-credit' with monetary equivalence for UX only; coins are redeemable as discounts on future orders only. Coins expire in 90 days by default.</pre>

    <div class="note" style="margin-top:8px">Important: because coins are non-withdrawable and usable only against purchases, they count as discounts (marketing expense) rather than cash payouts. This reduces legal/regulatory scrutiny compared to cash commissions across levels.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Platform money flow (one order)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Customer pays: item_price (P) + delivery_fee (D) + taxes.</li>
      <li>Payment gateway collects funds and settles net to platform (or using split-payments, splits to merchant & platform according to rules).</li>
      <li>From item_price P:
        <ul>
          <li>Merchant receives 70% of P (after marketplace settlement & taxes).</li>
          <li>Referral pool receives 5% of P (credited as coins to qualifying referrers according to referral ledger rules).</li>
          <li>Platform retains 25% of P (20% commission + 5% maintenance) as revenue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Delivery fee D: collected from customer; platform keeps handling fee (₹5–10) and pays remaining D to rider (or to courier partner if outsourced).</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Technical architecture (MERN, minimal components)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Simple, scalable components for a local-first web-only MVP (PWA-ready):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React + Tailwind CSS (PWA support for offline & web-push). Single codebase deployed to static hosting (CDN) with an API server.</li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js + Express (REST) + Socket.IO for real-time order updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB Atlas (start with free/low-tier cluster). Use collections: users, merchants, orders, riders, referralLedger, settlements.</li>
      <li><strong>Cache / Jobs:</strong> Redis for caching, rate-limits & short locks. Use a task queue (BullMQ or similar) for background jobs (settlement, email/SMS batching).</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> S3-compatible (DigitalOcean Spaces / AWS S3) for images and receipt files.</li>
      <li><strong>Third parties:</strong> Payment Gateway (Razorpay/Cashfree), Maps (Mapbox or Google Maps), SMS (MSG91), Push (Firebase Cloud Messaging), Email (SendGrid).</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Docker + Nginx reverse-proxy. Start with 1-2 droplets (or small VM instances) and upgrade as usage grows. Optionally use managed Kubernetes if you expect rapid scaling.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Data model (MongoDB collections sketch)</h2>
    <pre class="mono">users { _id, name, phone, email, referralCode, referredBy, wallet:{coins, history[]}, createdAt }
merchants { _id, name, address, fssai, menu:[{itemId,name,price,variants}], payoutAccount, rating, createdAt }

referralLedger { _id, orderId, fromUser, toUser, level, coins, status, issuedAt }
settlements { _id, merchantId, periodStart, periodEnd, gross, platformShare, referralShare, payoutAmount }
</pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>API endpoints (essential)</h2>
    <pre class="mono">POST /api/auth/otp/request -> send OTP
POST /api/auth/otp/verify -> verify & create session
GET  /api/merchants -> list merchants (query: location, category)
GET  /api/merchant/:id/menu -> get menu
POST /api/cart/checkout -> start checkout (calculates delivery fee & estimates)
POST /api/payment/webhook -> payment gateway webhook (idempotent)
POST /api/orders/:id/assign -> assign rider
POST /api/rider/:id/status -> rider updates (pickup/deliver)
GET  /api/user/wallet -> wallet & coins
POST /api/referral/redeem -> apply coins/referral code

    <h2>Infrastructure & pricing (detailed)</h2>
    <p class="muted">Costs below show one-time and recurring technical costs you must budget for since development itself will be handled by you and your partner.</p>

    <h3>One-time setup</h3>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Estimate (INR)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Domain (.com or .in)</td><td>₹800 – ₹1,500 / year</td><td>Registrar pricing varies; choose .in for local branding if desired.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SSL certificate</td><td>₹0 – ₹3,000</td><td>Use Let's Encrypt (free) for most cases; paid cert optional.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MongoDB Atlas initial setup (paid cluster optional)</td><td>Free – ₹3,000</td><td>Start on free tier; upgrade when needed.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Monthly recurring (small-city MVP)</h3>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Estimate / month (INR)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>App server (1 small droplet / VM)</td><td>₹350 – ₹1,200</td><td>DigitalOcean droplets start from ~$4–6/month. Use two small instances for redundancy if budget allows.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Managed DB (small Atlas cluster)</td><td>₹0 – ₹3,000</td><td>Free for small usage; paid cluster for production reliability.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Storage (images) & CDN</td><td>₹300 – ₹2,000</td><td>DigitalOcean Spaces or S3; CDN via Cloudflare free tier recommended.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Maps & routing (Google / Mapbox)</td><td>₹1,000 – ₹15,000+</td><td>Highly variable: depends on geocoding, distance-matrix and routing calls. Start with Mapbox to reduce cost and move to Google if needed.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SMS (OTP & transactional)</td><td>₹1,000 – ₹8,000</td><td>MSG91/Twilio: OTPs + critical messages only (use push notifications for most updates).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Monitoring & error tracking</td><td>₹500 – ₹3,000</td><td>Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana hosted costs.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Payment gateway fees</td><td>~1.5% – 2.5% of GMV (variable)</td><td>Not a fixed monthly cost; appears on transaction basis.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="muted">Conservative estimate monthly total for MVP (technical costs only): <strong>₹4,000 – ₹32,000</strong>. The primary cost driver is Maps & SMS usage which scale with order volume.</p>
